This is my solution and strategy to the RSSB Frontend Engineering challenge.
NB: This codebase is the frontend-only version of the full stack project in this repository: [https://github.com/Samuel-Anumudu/support-ticket]. Doing this is so that anyone running this codebase can run the client without extra server/database configuration.

## Clone Repository

First, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Samuel-Anumudu/support-ticket-v2.git]
```

## Install Dependencies

Inside the root directory, run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Start Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Strategy To Revamp Hotels&Co

In the process of revamping a legacy application like "Hotels&Co", I will incorporate the following strategies to accomplish this mission:

1. Team Formation and Kick-off:

- I will assemble the entire cross-functional team, including back-end and front-end developers, UI/UX designers, a product owner, scrum master, and subject matter experts.
- I will host a comprehensive kick-off meeting to introduce the project, set clear expectations, timelines, and establish individual roles and responsibilities. This meeting will serve as the foundation for collaborative work throughout the project.

2. Innovative Requirements Gathering:

- To foster creativity and collaboration, I will organize a hackathon or ideation session where team members can propose innovative ideas and solutions.
- I shall use this creative input to drive the process of gathering requirements and ensure that the team is motivated and engaged from the start.

3. Collaborative Design and UI/UX:

- I will ensure there is close collaboration with UI/UX designers to ensure the creation of exceptional user experiences.
- I will establish a regular design sync or design criticism session to review wireframes and prototypes, emphasizing the importance of responsive web design principles for multi-device support.

4. Software Engineering Best Practices:

- I will ensure both front-end and back-end developers work closely to build a robust code architecture.
- There must be a defined clear software testing strategies, with an emphasis on unit, integration, and end-to-end testing. Promote thorough documentation of API endpoints to facilitate efficient collaboration between teams.

5. Agile Development Process:

- I will implement an Agile development process that includes sprints and regular review meetings.
- I will continue to emphasize the importance of effective version control and branching strategies to manage code changes and maintain transparency throughout the development process.

6. Coding Standards and Testing:

- I will establish and enforce best coding standards to maintain code quality.
- We shall implement automated testing for unit, integration, and end-to-end scenarios to ensure the robustness of the application.
- We shall also test new features within a staging environment before pushing them to the live production environment to minimize potential disruptions.

7. Performance Optimization:

- We will continuously monitor the application's performance, addressing issues related to loading times and responsiveness.
- We will conduct load testing to ensure the application can handle the expected user load, guaranteeing a smooth and reliable user experience.

8. Security and Compliance:

- Implement best practices for security to protect user data.
- Ensure strict adherence to data protection regulations as defined by the company and relevant stakeholders. This step is crucial for maintaining user trust and compliance with legal requirements.

9. Bug Tracking and Resolution:

- Maintain a well-organized bug inventory to track and prioritize identified issues.
- Prioritize the most critical and impactful bugs for resolution, ensuring a smooth user experience and a polished final product.

10. Product Owner Involvement:

- Maintain clear and consistent communication with the product owner throughout the project.
- Ensure alignment with project expectations, gather feedback, and make necessary adjustments to the development process to meet evolving requirements.

11. Controlled Deployment and Monitoring:

- Develop a controlled deployment plan that includes rollback procedures to address any unforeseen issues.
- Vigilantly monitor the production environment during the initial days post-launch to identify and address any potential disruptions or glitches, ensuring a seamless transition for users.

12. User and Stakeholder Feedback:

- After a reasonable period post-launch, actively seek feedback from users and stakeholders.
- Use this feedback to evaluate the success of the project and plan for further improvements, ensuring that the application evolves to meet changing needs and expectations.
